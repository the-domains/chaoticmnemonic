She turns desert to ocean, adding viscosity to image creation. The pair is swimming in the pool of persistence, pausing to resonate and adjust, keeping each other informed until a chemical swoop connects the dots, and the phonemes and syllables turn into polysyllabic weaves. Inspiration comes sometimes at the moment of the spark, but it also comes in a state of balance when just enough emptiness provokes the urge to fill, manifesting the will to be alive.
